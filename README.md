# Map Vote +

Allows you and your friends to vote for the next map to play!

- Vote for any map
- Vote out of a selection of maps (like 3 random maps each round)
- Randomly select a map

## Massive thank you

and changes of my own

## Changes from Map Vote

- You can set a maximum number of maps to vote on that rotate every round (0-10)
